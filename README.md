# indexer-service-rs

## Introduction

A Rust impl for The Graph [indexer service](https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer/tree/main/packages/indexer-service) to provide data services as an Indexer, integrated with [TAP](https://github.com/semiotic-ai/timeline-aggregation-protocol) which is a fast, efficient, and trustless unidirectional micro-payments system.

## Features

- Receive paid or free query requests and route to graph node
- Route "meta" queries on indexing statuses and deployment health
- Serve indexer information such as health, indexer version, and operator address
- Monitor allocations, attestation signers, and manage receipts using TAP, store receipts in the indexer database
- Record performance and service metrics

## Quick start

```txt
$ cargo run -p indexer-service-rs -- --help

Usage: indexer-service-rs --config <FILE>

Options:
      --config <FILE>  Path to the configuration file.
                       See https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer-rs/tree/main/config for examples.
  -h, --help           Print help
```

All the configuration is done through a TOML file. Please see up-to-date TOML configuration templates:

- [Minimal configuration template (recommended)](config/minimal-config-example.toml)
- [Maximal configuration template (not recommended, dangerous settings)](config/maximal-config-example.toml)

## Upgrading

We follow conventional semantics for package versioning. An indexer may set a minor version specification for automatic patch updates while preventing breaking changes. To safely upgrading the package, we recommend the following steps:

1. **Review Release Notes**: Before upgrading, check the release notes for the new version to understand what changes, fixes, or new features are included.
2. **Review Documentation**: Check the up-to-date documentation for an accurate reflection of the changes made during the upgrade.
3. **Backup Configuration**: Save your current configuration files and any local modifications you've made to the existing codebase.
4. **Deploy**: Replace the old executable or docker image with the new one and restart the service to apply the upgrade.
5. **Monitor and Validate**: After the upgrade, monitor system behavior and performance metrics to validate that the service is running as expected.

These steps should ensure a smooth transition to the latest version of `indexer-service-rs`, harnessing new capabilities while maintaining system integrity.

## Dependency choices

- switching from actix-web to `axum` for the service server
- App profiling should utilize `perf`, flamegraphs or cpu profilers, and benches to track and collect performance data. The typescript implementation uses `gcloud-profile`
- Consider replacing and adding parts from TAP manager
- `postgres` database connection required to indexer management server database, shared with the indexer agent
- No migration in indexer service as it might introduce conflicts to the database; indexer agent is solely responsible for database management.

### Indexer common components

Temporarily live inside the indexer-service package under `src/common`.

Simple indexer management client to track NetworkSubgraph and postgres connection.

- NetworkSubgraph instance track both remote API endpoint and local deployment query endpoint.
  - TODO: query indexing status of local deployment, only use remote API as fallback.
- Keeps cost model schema and resolvers with postgres and graphQL types: `costModel(deployment)` and `costModels(deployments)`. If deployments is empty, all cost models are returned.
  - Global cost model fallback used when specific deployments are queried
- No database migration in indexer service as it might introduce schema conflicts; indexer agent is solely responsible for database management.

### Indexer native dependency

Linked dependency could not be linked directly with git url "https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer" and path "packages/indexer-native/native" at the same time, and could not access it on crates.io. So copid the folder to local repo with the version at https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer/blob/972658b3ce8c512ad7b4dc575d29cd9d5377e3fe/packages/indexer-native/native.

Since indexer-service will be written in Rust and no need for typescript, indexer-native's neon build and util has been removed.

Component `NativeSignatureVerifier` renamed to `SignatureVerifier`.

Separate package in the workspace under 'native'.

### common-ts components

Temporarily live inside the indexer-service package under `src/types`
