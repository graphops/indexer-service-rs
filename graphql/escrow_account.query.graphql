# EscrowAccountQuery
# 
# This query is used to retrieve escrow account information related to The Graph's Indexer
# TAP (Token Allocation Program) payment system.
#
# Input Variables:
# - $indexer (ID!): The unique ID of the Indexer whose escrow accounts are being queried.
# - $thawEndTimestamp (BigInt!): A timestamp used to filter signers whose thaw period has ended or is about to end.
#
# Query Logic:
# - Fetches escrow accounts where the `receiver` is the provided $indexer.
# - Returns the following information for each escrow account:
#   - `balance`: The current balance of the escrow account.
#   - `totalAmountThawing`: The total amount currently thawing in the escrow.
# - Retrieves the sender of the funds and filters the sender's `signers` based on the following:
#   - `thawEndTimestamp_lte`: Only includes signers whose thaw end timestamp is less than or equal to the provided $thawEndTimestamp.
#   - `isAuthorized: true`: Only includes signers that are authorized.
#
# Example Use Case:
# This query helps Indexers track escrow payments, including which funds are in the process of
# thawing and which signers are eligible to authorize transactions based on thaw end timestamps.

query EscrowAccountQuery($indexer: ID!, $thawEndTimestamp: BigInt!) {
    escrowAccounts(where: { receiver_: { id: $indexer } }) {
        balance
        totalAmountThawing
        sender {
            id
            signers(where: {
                thawEndTimestamp_lte: $thawEndTimestamp
                isAuthorized: true
            }) {
                id
            }
        }
    }
}
